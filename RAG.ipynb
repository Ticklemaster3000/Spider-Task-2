      "You see, traditional left-to-right models are like a one-way street, only looking at the context to the left of the current token. They're limited in their ability to capture the nuances of language. On the other hand, BERT is like a two-lane highway, considering both the left and right contexts simultaneously. This bidirectional approach allows it to better understand the relationships between words and their meanings.\n",
      "\n",
      "And let me tell you, my friend, this makes all the difference in the world. The masked language modeling task we use to pre-train BERT is like a puzzle, where the model has to figure out the missing tokens based on the context. It's not just about predicting the next word; it's about understanding the underlying structure of language.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I know what you're thinking: \"Yoichiro, why not use traditional left-to-right models?\" Well, my friend, those models are like a one-trick pony. They can only do one thing well, whereas BERT is like a Swiss Army knife - it can be used for a variety of tasks, from language translation to text generation.\n",
